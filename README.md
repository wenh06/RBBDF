# RBBDF

Python re-implementation of the RBBDF algorithm proposed in [`Localized matrix factorization for recommendation based on matrix block diagonal forms`](http://yongfeng.me/attach/lmf-zhang.pdf) ([ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2488388.2488520)).

## NOTE

Despite the required packages, one should also `cd` into the submodule [`networkx-metis`](networkx-metis) and run

```bash
python setup.py install
```

to install `nxmetis`.
